# Real-VS-Fake-Face-Detection
This project implements a real-time system to distinguish between real and fake (AI-generated or deepfake) faces. We combine **YOLOv8** for face detection with **handcrafted heuristics** like blur detection, texture analysis, and color variance to assess the authenticity of faces.

## Abstract
A real-time fake face detection system using YOLOv8 and traditional image analysis. Results show high accuracy in detecting synthetic faces under various conditions.
